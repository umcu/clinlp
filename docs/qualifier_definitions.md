# Qualifier operational definitions

It's useful to have some operational definitions of a qualifier/context, i.e. what we mean exactly when we talk about negations, hypothetical situations, etc. For now the framework we use can be found here: [qualifiers.docx](qualifiers.docx). This information will be incorporated in a separate documentation page in the near future.
