## Contributing

`clinlp` is intended as a community project, and as such your contribution is very welcome. We hope to set up some more extensive contributing guidelines in the near future. For now, here is some basic information for starters: 

* PRs are welcome, but if you are planning extensive changes, please do get in touch beforehand. This holds both for your own ideas, and for items already on our roadmap. 
* Keep in mind that `clinlp` consists of **generic** components that process **clinical** text written in **Dutch**. If your contribution does not meet those three criteria, a separate release might be a better option. 
* We aim for production ready code, that is well tested, scalable, maintainable, SOLID, etc., but we can help with refactoring code to reach that point. 
* We try to use [issues](https://github.com/umcu/clinlp/issues/new) for communication as much as possible, but you can reach the maintainers by [e-mail](mailto:analytics@umcutrecht.nl) if that doesn't work.
